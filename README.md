## About Me
With a Masterâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering, I have a solid foundation in fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and advanced numerical methods. Over the past two and a half years, I have gained hands-on experience in conducting CFD simulations, specifically in multiphase flows. I am proficient in utilizing commercial CFD tools such as Ansys Fluent and STAR-CCM+, and I have also developed in-house CFD solvers. My skills extend to creating complex meshes and performing detailed analysis to optimize fluid dynamics simulations. Currently, I am in the process of obtaining my Engineer-in-Training (EIT) certification, positioning myself to earn a Professional Engineer (P.Eng.) license within 2-3 years.

## Skills & Tools
- ANSYS Workbench, STAR-CCM+
- Python, MATLAB, and FORTRAN
- 2D and 3D CAD Design, Mesh Generation, Multiphase Models, Turbulence Models, and Post-Processing
